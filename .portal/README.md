# Even Pickier Dollies

This is a fork of the [Picker Dollies](https://github.com/Nexela/PickerDollies) mod by @nexela which has been modified to work with Factorio 2.0.

Nexela did awesome work with this for Factorio 1.1. I will claim responsibility for all the bugs that this mod shows with Factorio 2.0.

If you encounter problems with this mod, please check out the [README](https://github.com/hgschmie/factorio-even-pickier-dollies/blob/main/README.md) and report them on the [Mod Discussion group](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/even-pickier-dollies/discussion) or on [github](https://github.com/hgschmie/factorio-even-pickier-dollies/issues).l

Hover over entities and use the keybindings to move entities around. Entities will keep their wire connections and settings. This allows you to build your set up spaced out and when you are finished push it all together for a nice tight build. Some entities can't be shoved around. Also respects max wire distance.

Note: Moving some modded entities that rely on position can cause issues. There is an API available that mod authors can use to be notified of these events. This module retains the 'PickerDollies' API name to be compatible with all the other things out there that interface with it.
